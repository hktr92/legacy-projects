When I started programming back in 2013, I was a passionate Metin2 player. So I learned PHP by doing work for some server admins.

A non-exhaustive list of platforms and / or private servers:
- DigitalMt2 -- I.. can't remember exactly this one.
- Metin2Rapsodia -- patching up issues by my then-nemesis, DarkDev.
- 4Metin.ro -- the OG one that closed back in 2014 (RIP).
- joaca.4mt.ro -- it was 4Metin.ro community server. i swear i had the source code somewhere but i can't remember where... the design was cool, ngl, paid by llegolas.
- 4metin homepage -- it was a homepage paid for by the community's leader, llegolas, released for free.

There were also some initiatives to release my own metin2 homepage back then, but i never did release one.
The closest one I ever had to release was re-used in joaca.4mt.ro and llegolas asked for eclusivity, which I did.

Now that I'm thinking, I've never been a good frontend developer myself. I always focused on the backend part, with PHP. That's another reason why I never released Async2 CMS.

## legal stuff here
I know that Metin2 is a proprietary game. I was a kid when I played around with private servers.

But for this release, just to make sure, I changed the source code with following changes:
- removed any credentials found in the source code (such as: IPs, collected IPs);
- removed any database dumps I have found;
- removed any proprietary code;
- commented out any web shells i found (they were popular back then);

Some 3rd party libraries still has their license listed at the beginning of the file.

## why the release?
I just found these on a backup drive and got nostalgic. Being curious about how I coded back then, I opened them.
Because most of these relied on PHP 5.2 - 5.5, all except one project (written by me, which relied on PHP 5.6) won't work anymore.

I don't want to make them work for the previews, I just want to give it for historic purposes.

## final thoughts
it was nice to relieve my childhood experiences as an adult, but from coding point... it's so painful to see that horrible spaghetti code.

it took me 3 hours to sweep through the code and exclude any TOSable code...

i think it's a nice piece of history regarding the metin2 private server scene in romania, since i grew up with it.
